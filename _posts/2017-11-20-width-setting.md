Below we will compare the three possible options for the width settings side by side to see the differences. 

For now, only the multiple column arrangements in the cast and crew type sections are affected, so we will look at the cast section. 

You can resize your browser to see the behaviour of each option in different screen view sizes. Of course, if you we&#8217;re to have a sidebar or two it would decrease the total width available, but at least it will give us an idea of how these settings affect the number of columns per case.
