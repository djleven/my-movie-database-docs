The My Movie Database plugin compliments your content by allowing you to add detailed information about movies, television shows and people in the industry.

This plugin was developed to enrich your movie or tvshow critique / review by &#8216;automatically&#8217; adding the related information and allowing you to focus on your writing instead.

You can use it via shortcodes or the standard posts method.

The data comes from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (TMDb), the leading crowdsourced movie industry information community. This plugin is in no way endorsed or supported by TMDb.
